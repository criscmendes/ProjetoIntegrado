Each session, led by a zookeeper, lasts about 20 minutes and is open to guests ages 3 and up, according to its website.\\n\"During the encounter, participants and the rhinoceroses are separated by a series of steel poles. According to witnesses, the child stumbled and fell in between two of the poles and at this point, the snout of at least one of rhinoceroses made contact with the child,\" according to the statement.\\nThe zoo, which houses more than 900 animals, has hosted the Rhino Encounter since 2009, the statement said. Keith Winsten, the executive director of the zoo, said in a statement that it would be suspended until they have “thoroughly reviewed our processes and procedures to ensure this cannot happen again.”\\n“Our number one concern is the safety and welfare of our guests and our hearts go out to the family,” he said.\\nThe incident comes days after 22-year-old Alexandra Black was killed in a lion attack at a zoo in North Carolina. Black was an intern at the Conservators Center in Burlington and was cleaning an animal enclosure when the lion escaped from a locked gate, officials said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
       "A few years ago, we stayed in a cottage in the Yorkshire Dales. One night, we went for a drink in the local. It was plastered inside and out with union jacks. The moment I saw the flags, the hairs on my neck stood up. Anyone black or Asian who had grown up in 70s and 80s Britain would probably have felt the same. The union jack in those days was a sign, meaning: “Beware, fascists around”.\\nLittondale in the 2010s is, of course, a very different place from east London in the 1980s and the meaning of the union jack very different too. The pub was welcoming and friendly and we returned there more than once. And yet I know that the next time I see a pub plastered with union jacks, the hairs of my neck once more will stand up.\\nSigns and symbols are essential to our lives, helping us navigate the social world and allowing us to link outward appearance to some inner essence or truth. They provide a means of signalling who we are and what we stand for. It’s why we wear badges and ribbons, why many Jewish men wear the kippa and some Muslim women the hijab.\\nThe way we read signs, and the meanings we attribute to them, is not necessarily rational, as my response to the union jacks expressed. Personal experience has embedded in me a reflexive response to a particular sign.\\nThe distortion in the way people interpret social signs can be profoundly damaging. Racism attributes to surface markers a pernicious deeper meaning. To a racist, a black skin can be a sign of threat or of inferiority, an immigrant, a signal of social degradation.\\nAbusive views were stitched into the Brexit debate long before far-right idiots in yellow jackets hijacked College Green\\nIn a recent essay, the Conservative activist Graeme Archer suggested that we live today in an “age of semiotics” in which signs have become both all-important and peculiarly distorted. Signs have become “tribalised” and “the deconstruction of signs… has become our chief political diagnostic”. There is truth to this. Consider the Brexit debate. The hostility and harassment faced by the Tory Remainer Anna Soubry dominated much discussion over the past week. “This is what has happened to our country,” Soubry observed in the infamous interview on London’s College Green drowned out by chants of “Soubry is a Nazi”. She was right, though perhaps not quite in the way she meant.\\nIt’s not, as Soubry seemed to suggest, that the Brexit debate has created a tribalised Britain in which people with whom you disagree become fair game to be harassed and denounced as Nazis. Rather, it is that a more tribalised Britain has meant that the Brexit debate is inevitably now seen in tribal terms.\\nAbusive views of opponents were stitched into the Brexit debate long before far-right idiots in yellow jackets hijacked College Green. Almost from the beginning, Remainers dismissed Brexiters as ignorant and racist. Brexiters denounced Remainers as traitors and enemies of the people. No doubt, on reading this, both sides will insist: “Yes, but we’re right and they’re wrong.”\\nOne way in which people try to make sense of this is in the observation that we are living in a more polarised society. A divided Britain is not, however, anything new. The miners’ strike of 1984-85 created far greater social instability than anything we are witnessing today. In 1926, the General Strike led the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, to claim that union leaders were “threatening the basis of ordered government, and going nearer to proclaiming civil war than we have been for centuries past”.\\nMPs raise safety fears with police after Anna Soubry subjected to 'Nazi’ chants Read more\\nWhat is peculiar today is not polarisation itself, but the manner of division. In the past, the distinction between left and right gave people a means of making sense of social divisions. That distinction no longer provides a useful compass for today’s political landscape. In the past, movements for social change helped shape peoples’ ideals and gave meaning to national fault lines. Today’s polarisation is disconnected from any such movements, making divisions appear more arbitrary and more intractable.\\nToday, British politics seems simultaneously to be chaotic and immovable. The Brexit process has exposed a fragmented political class with few ideas, seemingly unable to govern the nation. Yet public attitudes have barely changed towards Brexit. And, for all the disasters faced by the Tory party, Labour has been unable to take advantage. Britain is socially polarised, yet politically paralysed. As a result, politics skates largely on the surface. It is this degradation of politics that has made signs all-important. They are what’s left and what we polarise around.\\n• Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist       1\n",

The very least he could have done was to contact us and let us know what he was planning.\\n“It will be horrific if this film wins an Oscar or any awards, given the disregard shown to James’s family.”\\nFormer police chief Albert Kirby, who led the investigation into the murder, agreed with Ralph.\\nHe said: “I think it lacks any form of taste or decency and has been made without any consideration of the effect on Denise [Fergus, James’s mum], the family and also any number of other people who were involved in the sensitive issues of the ­investigation.”\\nDirector Vincent Lambe admitted last week he did not contact Ralph or Denise , 51, before releasing the film last year. He said: “I think they wouldn’t want a film like this to be made.”\\n(Image: Getty Images)\\nBut the 38-year-old defended his take on the movie about Venables and Thompson, believed to the first drama about the killing.\\nHe told Good Morning Britain: “A lot of people might feel it’s wrong to humanise those boys but I think if people can’t accept the fact that they were human beings they will never be able to begin to ­understand what could have driven them to commit such a crime.\\nAnd the only way to prevent something like this happening again in the future is to understand the cause of it.”\\nDetainment was released last year and shown at a number of European film festivals.\\nIt won the Don Quixote Award at the Krakow Film Festival and is on the Academy Awards shortlist for best Live Action Short Film after scooping best ­International Film at Odense in Denmark last August.\\nIn June it received a standing ovation at the Young Directors Award Ceremony in Cannes.\\n(Image: Billy Griffiths)\\nMr Lambe said at the time: ­“Detainment is a film about ­something very sensitive which divides public opinion, but I think people should remember that while the film is factual, it really just gives a brief glimpse of one aspect of the case.\\n“There is a much wider story there and it is a heartbreaking one. It’s impossible to show the unimaginable pain of James Bulger’s family in the space of a short film.\\n“I would hope that audiences would be left wanting to know more and start researching the case for themselves. And if it sparks a debate, then that’s probably a good thing.”\\nBut Ralph said: “If the film maker had done his homework he would see he brings nothing new to the table other than a macabre fascination and obsession about James’ murder.”\\nThe youngster was killed after being lured away from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, by Thompson and Venables.\\nThe pair were convicted the same year and granted lifelong anonymity when released from prison aged 18.\\nVenables, now 36, has since been jailed twice for child porn offences.\\nHe is played by actor Ely Solan and Leon Hughes portrays Thompson.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "You would think by now that people would have learned to act respectfully around service dogs and their handlers, but sadly this doesn’t always seem to be the case.\\nWhile it is tempting to want to go up and pet them, it is important that service dogs are not distracted while working and can maintain focus on their handler.\\nBut one woman became enraged after being told her daughter couldn’t pat a group of service dogs in a mall in Pittsburgh.\\nThe mum was dubbed \"Service Dog Sally” after a video of the incident went viral, with over eight million views.\\nMegan Stoff, the handler who posted the clip to Facebook, said that the woman had originally walked away after being told she couldn’t touch the dogs, but came back moments later to criticise the way the situation was handled.\\nShe wrote:\\nThis lady went out of her way to come back with her child and yell at us for saying ‘no’ and for not saying, ‘no I’m sorry they’re training'... Entitlement these days is real. They even got mall security because we said they couldn’t pet the working dog.\\nWhile at least one of the dogs in the video is seen to be clearly labelled as a service animal, the woman can be heard arguing that the handlers should have signage warning people not to touch them.\\nStoff then tells the woman:\\nIt literally says ‘do not pet’ on every single dog . There's like four signs.\\nThe woman finally ends her rant by insisting it is “illegal” to film her and that she will call her lawyer.\\nSigh.\\nvia GIPHY\\nMore: Woman dumps her cheating boyfriend in savage speech at birthday party                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           21\n",

Seems like more than that would be overkill at this point. — Katie Mack (@AstroKatie) August 16, 2016\\nThis legendary burn was so good it even prompted some hilarious reactions.\\nHT Someecards\\nMore: Trump ally believes climate change isn't real because Venus 'is still there'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        20\n",

The very least he could have done was to contact us and let us know what he was planning.\\n“It will be horrific if this film wins an Oscar or any awards, given the disregard shown to James’s family.”\\nFormer police chief Albert Kirby, who led the investigation into the murder, agreed with Ralph.\\nHe said: “I think it lacks any form of taste or decency and has been made without any consideration of the effect on Denise [Fergus, James’s mum], the family and also any number of other people who were involved in the sensitive issues of the ­investigation.”\\nDirector Vincent Lambe admitted last week he did not contact Ralph or Denise , 51, before releasing the film last year.

It’s impossible to show the unimaginable pain of James Bulger’s family in the space of a short film.\\n“I would hope that audiences would be left wanting to know more and start researching the case for themselves. And if it sparks a debate, then that’s probably a good thing.”\\nBut Ralph said: “If the film maker had done his homework he would see he brings nothing new to the table other than a macabre fascination and obsession about James’ murder.”\\nThe youngster was killed after being lured away from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, by Thompson and Venables.\\nThe pair were convicted the same year and granted lifelong anonymity when released from prison aged 18.\\nVenables, now 36, has since been jailed twice for child porn offences.\\nHe is played by actor Ely Solan and Leon Hughes portrays Thompson.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
